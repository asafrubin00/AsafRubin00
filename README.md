<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My academic background combined with my commercial experience has given me a comprehensive perspective on how data can be leveraged as a valuable strategic resource. My PhD (Management Science) thesis was an investigation of the relationships between knowledge, innovation and productivity. I have spent the last five years working in the Executive Search industry, first as a Knowledge Consultant, where I applied the academic theory I had learned in a commercial setting and collaborated with senior stakeholders to win business by providing actionable insights based on market data. In my current role as a Data Insights Consultant, I transform internal analytics into insights to identify new strategic business opportunities and facilitate data-driven decision-making.</p>
